## Description 

Welcome to my Employee Tracker! Business owners often need an easy way to get a look at their organization's human resources. This is a command-line application that allows users to create, read, update and delete from a database of the departments within their business, their employees, their roles within the organization, and their salaries.

## Installation

To use this application, clone the repository from github, and be sure to install the dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Usage

When you run `node server.js`, you will be prompted with a question asking what you would like to manage. From there, simply follow the user-friendly prompts (using arrows keys to navigate) and you will be good-to-go. Note that when you choose to view one of the databases, you will need to escape out by typing `control-C` and restart the application to continue, since it was discovered during testing that the database table and the "start" menu were visibly overlapping in the console.
